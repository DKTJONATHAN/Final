## NAIROBI, Kenya â€“ Gor Mahia's Title Redemption Mission

Kenya's most decorated football club has launched an unprecedented transfer blitz, signing five Harambee Stars players in a single day as they seek to reclaim dominance in the 2025/26 Football Kenya Federation Premier League (FKFPL) season. After their first trophyless campaign in nine years, the record 20-time champions are leaving nothing to chance with strategic acquisitions and renewed financial backing.

### The Wake-Up Call: 2024/25 Season Review

The Green Army's disappointing campaign saw them finish second with 59 points (16W, 11D, 7L), six points behind champions Kenya Police FC. Critical stumbles included a 2-1 loss to Nairobi City Stars and a 0-0 draw against Murang'a Seal.

### Transfer Revolution: National Team Talent Influx

On August 12, 2025, the club announced five key signings from rival FKFPL clubs, bolstering all areas of the squad. The new arrivals bring both domestic league experience and national team pedigree.
