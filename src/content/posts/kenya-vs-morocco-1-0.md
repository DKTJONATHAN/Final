Undeterred, Kenya, backed by a frenzied crowd, struck gold in the 40th minute.

### Second Half Heroics Seal Victory

Morocco pushed back fiercely in the second half, with Imad Riahi testing goalkeeper Byrne Omondi, whose heroics kept Kenya in the lead. A critical moment came in the 68th minute when Morocco appealed for a penalty, only for VAR to rule no foul, prompting roars of approval from the stands. Coach Benni McCarthy's tactical substitutions, including Aboud Omar and Daniel Sakari for Mohammed Siraj and Suleiman Manzur, fortified Kenya's defense against Morocco's late changes of Boughrine and Medri. The Stars held firm, their resolve matched by the deafening support of fans who had stormed the gates.
