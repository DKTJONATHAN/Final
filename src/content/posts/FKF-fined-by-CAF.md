NAIROBI, Kenya, August 13, 2025, 11:05 AM EAT – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has fined the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) $50,000 for multiple safety and security breaches during Kenya's TotalEnergies CAF African Nations Championship (CHAN) match against Morocco at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The Disciplinary Board found Kenya guilty and warned that persistent violations could lead to relocating national team matches to Uganda and Tanzania. This comes as Kenya, already selected to co-host the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with Uganda and Tanzania, faces mounting risks of losing its hosting rights due to ongoing security lapses.

The recent CHAN match saw inadequate security personnel and ignored road closures, allowing unauthorized access. Earlier incidents include the July 2025 World Cup qualifier against Seychelles, where fans breached barriers and stormed the pitch after a 2-0 win, delaying the game by 30 minutes due to understaffed stewards. In June 2025, a friendly against South Sudan in Nairobi saw a spectator scuffle and thrown objects injure two officers amid poor crowd control. These recurring issues have raised alarms, especially as CHAN 2024 serves as a trial for the 2027 AFCON bid.

Kenya's history of losing hosting rights—such as the 1996 AFCON and 2018 CHAN due to inadequate facilities—adds weight to the current threat. CAF's warning suggests that failure to improve security, including deploying sufficient personnel and enforcing protocols, could jeopardize Kenya's role in the tri-nation Pamoja bid. With significant investments in stadium upgrades underway, the FKF and government must act swiftly to avoid a repeat of past failures and protect Kenya's AFCON 2027 aspirations. Updates will follow as the situation develops.
