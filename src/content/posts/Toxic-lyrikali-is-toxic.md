## Toxic Lyrikali's Fall from Grace

Once hailed as a rising star in Kenya's music scene, Toxic Lyrikali's meteoric rise has taken a sharp nosedive, revealing a personality steeped in pride, selfishness, and a shocking disregard for his fans. His recent appearance at State House on August 9, 2025, where he was coerced into chanting "Tutam" in support of President William Ruto's re election bid, has ignited a firestorm of backlash. But this incident is merely the tip of the iceberg for an artist whose ego has outgrown his talent, leaving fans questioning whether his two hit wonder status justifies the hype.

### The "Tutam" Fiasco: Selling Out for Clout

At a Nairobi County Empowerment Program hosted by President Ruto, Lyrikali took the stage to perform his viral start "Backbencher." But the moment that stole headlines came when Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie instructed him to say "Tutam," a politically charged phrase endorsing Ruto's second term. Lyrikali complied, grinning as he repeated the chant, instantly alienating fans who view "Tutam" as a betrayal of the "Wantam" movement for a single term presidency. Social media erupted, with X users slamming him as a sellout. One fan posted, "Toxic Lyrikali just proved he's for the bag, not the people. Done with him after that Tutam nonsense." Another wrote, "He's out here supporting a regime tied to abductions and violence. Trash human, trash music."

### A History of Arrogance: Snubbing Collaborations and Fans

The State House incident isn't Lyrikali's first brush with controversy. His refusal to collaborate with fellow artists has painted him as insufferably arrogant. In late July 2025, he publicly called out rappers like Tipsy Gee and Parroty Vunulu for "begging" for features, dismissing their requests with a smug, "Wait for the vibes to connect." X posts from the time labeled him "kiburi" (arrogant), with one user noting, "Toxic Lyrikali thinks he's above everyone else just because of two songs. Who does he think he is?" This prideful attitude reeks of selfishness, alienating peers who could have elevated his craft and fans who once saw him as relatable.

His dismissive demeanor extends beyond artists to his audience. Lyrikali rarely engages with fans on social media unless it's to flaunt his success or dodge accountability. When criticized, he doubles down, often framing himself as misunderstood rather than addressing concerns. This self centered approach has eroded the goodwill he once had, leaving many to question whether he ever cared about his supporters or simply used them as stepping stones.

### Two Hits, Zero Depth: The Myth of Lyrikali's Talent

Let's be real: Toxic Lyrikali's discography hinges on two catchy tracks, "Backbencher" and one other fleeting hit that rode the wave of social media trends. While these songs showcase his knack for punchy rhymes and viral beats, they mask a glaring lack of substance. Strip away the hype, and his music reveals itself as shallow repetitive flows, recycled themes, and a reliance on gimmicks over artistry. Fans on X have called it out, with one user bluntly stating, "Lyrikali's music is mid at best. Two bangers don't make you a legend. He's overhyped and overrated."

His inflated ego, fueled by these two songs, has blinded him to his limitations. Instead of honing his craft or diversifying his sound, Lyrikali leans into his fleeting fame, acting as if he's untouchable. This delusion has led him to prioritize clout chasing moments like the State House performance over building a legacy that resonates with Kenya's youth. His music, once seen as an anthem for the streets, now feels like a hollow bid for relevance.

### Why Lyrikali Doesn't Deserve Your Support

Toxic Lyrikali's actions paint a clear picture: he's an artist who values fame and political connections over integrity and community. His "Tutam" chant wasn't just a misstep it was a slap in the face to fans grappling with the realities of a government criticized for overtaxation and human rights concerns. His refusal to collaborate shows a selfish streak, hoarding opportunities while dismissing peers. And his music? It's a fleeting spark, not a lasting flame, propped up by an ego that far outstrips his talent.

Fans deserve artists who uplift, not betray. Lyrikali's toxic personality marked by pride, opportunism, and a disconnect from the people makes him unworthy of the platform he's been given. As one X user put it, "We gave him love, and he gave us arrogance. Time to move on." It's time to stop hyping an artist who's more about himself than the culture he claims to represent. Let's amplify voices that truly speak for the people, not those who chant for power.
