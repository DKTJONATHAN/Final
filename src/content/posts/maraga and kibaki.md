# From Kibaki to Maraga: Can Kenya’s Economy Rise Again?

As Kenya approaches the **2027 elections**, the nation finds itself at a pivotal moment. Under President **William Ruto**, economic struggles - high taxes, inflation, and public unrest - have fueled widespread discontent. Into this fray steps **David Maraga**, the former Chief Justice, campaigning to **"Reset, Restore, Rebuild"** Kenya. His candidacy invites comparisons to **Mwai Kibaki**, the economist turned president who rescued Kenya’s economy after decades of mismanagement under **Daniel arap Moi**.

## Kibaki’s Economic Turnaround: A Lesson in "Kibakinomics"

When Mwai Kibaki became president in December 2002, Kenya was on its knees. Economic growth had stalled at 0.6%, corruption was bleeding the country dry, and international donors had turned their backs. Kibaki rolled out a strategy dubbed "Kibakinomics":

1. **Tightened the Purse Strings**: Cut wasteful government spending and boosted tax collection
2. **Privatization Push**: Sold off state-owned companies
3. **Cracking Down on Corruption**: Fired 400 procurement officers
4. **Vision 2030**: Long-term plan prioritizing infrastructure and jobs
5. **Smart Balance**: Mixed free market ideas with strategic government moves

The results were stunning - GDP growth hit 7.1% by the end of his first term.

## Today’s Economic Mess Under Ruto

Kenya in 2025 faces:
- Tax Hikes and Inflation (50.5% say life's worse - Afrobarometer 2024)
- Street Anger (100+ dead in protests - BBC July 2025)
- Debt Trouble (4.3% fiscal deficit)

## Kibaki vs. Maraga: Economics Meets Governance

**Kibaki's Strengths:**
- Economic know-how
- Measurable results (0.6% → 7.1% GDP growth)
- Team player with experts

**Maraga's Approach:**
- Governance first (strong institutions)
- Corruption fighter
- Needs economic advisors

## Maraga’s Potential Playbook

If elected in 2027, Maraga might:
1. Strengthen institutions to attract investors
2. Clean up corruption to recover funds
3. Provide tax relief
4. Focus on inclusive growth

## The Bottom Line

Kenya needs both Kibaki's economic savvy and Maraga's moral compass. Whether Maraga can blend these will determine if Kenya's economy rises again.
