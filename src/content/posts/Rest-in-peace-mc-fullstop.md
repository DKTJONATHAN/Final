### Battle with Tuberculosis

Diagnosed with lung tuberculosis in 2021, Fullstop lost function in one lung. By 2022, throat TB restricted his ability to speak or perform. Despite these challenges, his openness about his health inspired fans, even as he considered retirement in 2023 due to permanent lung damage.
