## CHAN 2024's Dark Side: The Ticket Scandal

The 2024 African Nations Championship (CHAN), themed "PAMOJA" for unity across Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, has been anything but harmonious for Kenyan football enthusiasts. Hosted at Nairobi's iconic Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani, the tournament has been plagued by a rampant ticketing scam that has left hundreds of genuine fans frustrated, angry, and denied entry to matches. From fraudulent websites peddling invalid tickets to allegations of politicians bulk buying passes to distribute to their supporters, the chaos has killed the vibe of what should be a thrilling celebration of African football.

### The Fake Ticket Epidemic

At the heart of the issue is a sophisticated scam involving counterfeit tickets sold through fake platforms and street vendors. The official ticketing site, chan.mookh.com, was meant to ensure a seamless, digital only process with prices starting at Ksh 200 for regular seats. However, scammers created mirror sites like moohk.co.ke, tricking fans into buying invalid e tickets that get rejected at the gates. Victims have reported paying between Ksh 300 and Ksh 1,000 for these bogus passes, only to be turned away when scanners flag them as "already used" or fake.

Hundreds of fans fell prey during high stakes matches like Kenya vs. DR Congo on August 3 and Kenya vs. Morocco on August 10. On opening day, chaos erupted as frustrated supporters, locked out despite holding what they believed were legitimate tickets, overpowered police and stewards to storm the stadium. Videos circulating online show crowds breaching Gate 6, filling empty seats that highlighted the scam's broader impact: "sold out" games with visible vacant rows, particularly in VIP sections.

### Political Ticket Hoarding Exposed

Adding fuel to the fire are accusations of political meddling. Reports claim politicians and government officials purchased tickets in massive quantities to hand out to their loyalists, effectively sidelining true football fans. Social media exploded with evidence, including photos of individuals like "Omosh One Hour," an ODM supporter, holding entire booklets of tickets. Posts allege these were distributed to "manufactured fans" bused in from areas like Kibera to drown out potential anti government chants amid Kenya's ongoing political tensions.

A viral X post stated, "Politicians bought CHAN tickets in bulk so that they can give to their supporters, locking out thousands of genuine football fans." Another user shared, "See how #CHAN2024 tickets are being distributed by goons? Kasongo should be ashamed of himself," accompanied by images of bulk distributions. This hoarding led to absurd scenes: stadiums at 70% capacity despite official sell outs, with fans decrying, "People hoarded tickets sana."

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has already fined the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Ksh 2.5 million for crowd control failures, warning of harsher penalties if the issues persist.

### Victims Speak Out

The human cost of this scam is evident in the stories of fans turned away at Kasarani's gates. During the Kenya vs. DR Congo opener, hundreds arrived with tickets bought from third party vendors, only for scanners to reveal they were duplicates or already scanned likely resold multiple times by scalpers. One group of fans from Nairobi's Eastlands, who had purchased via a fake site, protested outside Gate 3 after their tickets were deemed invalid, leading to heated confrontations with security.

In a Citizen TV report, affected fans shared their anguish: "Kuna watu ambao wanatuuzia tickets bandia," lamented one victim who had traveled from Mombasa, only to be denied entry because his ticket was flagged as previously used. Another, who bought from a street seller near the stadium, echoed, "Kuna watu wanaenda wanabuy tickets mingi na hawatokei game," highlighting how hoarders buy in bulk but don't attend, leaving seats empty while real supporters are locked out.

### Calls for Reform and Accountability

The ticketing fiasco has dampened the excitement of CHAN 2024, turning a unifying event into a source of division and distrust. Fans have taken to social media with hashtags like #CHAN2024 and #KasaraniRoars to demand transparency, stricter anti scalping measures, and an end to political interference. As one X user put it, "This is scandalous, a sheer scam and fraud all day long."

With the Zambia vs. Kenya match looming and already sold out, the Local Organising Committee (LOC) and CAF must act swiftly. Enhanced verification, public awareness campaigns against fake sites, and limits on bulk purchases could restore faith. Until then, the beautiful game risks being overshadowed by ugly greed and confusion.

For the latest on CHAN 2024, stay tuned and buy tickets only from official sources to avoid the heartbreak.
