# What Happens When You Drink Snake Venom: Myths, Science, and Real Events

Snake venom is often feared as a deadly substance, but what happens if you ingest it orally rather than through a bite? Contrary to popular belief, drinking snake venom is generally not fatal for humans, though it's far from risk-free. This article delves into the scientifically proven effects, drawing from toxicology principles, and examines real-life cases where people have consumed venom—intentionally or otherwise.

## The Science Behind Snake Venom and Ingestion

Snake venom is a complex cocktail of proteins, enzymes, and peptides designed to immobilize prey when injected into the bloodstream. There are three main types: neurotoxins (affecting the nervous system), hemotoxins (disrupting blood clotting and causing bleeding), and cytotoxins (damaging tissues). When venom enters the body via a snakebite, it bypasses the digestive system and directly impacts vital functions, potentially leading to paralysis, internal bleeding, or organ failure.

However, when ingested orally, venom behaves differently. As a protein-based substance, it is typically broken down by stomach acids and digestive enzymes, rendering it harmless before it can enter the bloodstream. This is why venom is classified as a "venom" (requiring injection) rather than a "poison" (harmful when ingested or absorbed). In most cases, drinking pure snake venom would cause no more than mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea or vomiting, if any symptoms occur at all.

That said, there are caveats:

Open Wounds or Ulcers: If there are cuts, sores, or ulcers in the mouth, throat, or digestive tract, venom could enter the bloodstream, mimicking the effects of a bite and potentially causing severe symptoms like coagulopathy (blood clotting issues) or respiratory failure.

Type of Venom: Cytotoxic venoms might cause local irritation or tissue damage in the mouth, though the oral mucosa's protective layer and rapid healing reduce this risk.

Quantity and Preparation: Large amounts or venom mixed with alcohol (as in "snake wine") could exacerbate effects, especially if contaminants are present.

Scientifically, the low oral toxicity of venom has been demonstrated in studies and videos explaining the biochemistry: proteins denature in the acidic stomach environment, preventing systemic absorption.

## Real-Life Cases of Drinking Snake Venom

While rare, documented incidents provide insight into the real-world outcomes of ingesting snake venom. These cases often involve cultural practices, recreational misuse, or accidents.

### Cultural and Traditional Practices

Snake Wine in Asia: In regions like Taiwan and Vietnam, "snake wine" is a traditional beverage where venomous snakes are steeped in alcohol. The venom dissolves into the liquid, but drinkers rarely experience severe effects due to digestion. However, a 2016 case reported in the *Journal of Emergency Medicine* described a man who developed severe coagulopathy after consuming snake wine, likely because the venom entered his system through an unknown pathway or due to high concentration. He required medical intervention but survived.

### Recreational Use and Addiction

Snake Venom as a Drug in India: In a disturbing trend, some individuals in India consume snake venom recreationally to achieve a "high." A 2021 case study detailed a man addicted to snake venom, using it as an alternative to alcohol. He ingested it orally or via bites, experiencing euphoria but also risking death from respiratory paralysis. In 2023, Indian YouTuber Elvish Yadav was implicated in a scandal where cobra venom was supplied for parties to induce intoxication. Police recovered snakes and venom, highlighting the psychoactive potential when mixed with other substances. Users report feelings of wellbeing, but the practice has led to fatalities from improper administration.

Powdered Venom Abuse: Venom is sometimes dried into powder (e.g., K-72 or K-76 from cobra venom) and mixed with alcohol or ingested directly. A 2022 review noted cases of impulsivity and polysubstance abuse among users, with risks including clotting disorders if absorbed systemically.

### Accidental or Experimental Ingestion

Self-Experimentation: Musician Steve Ludwin has injected himself with diluted snake venom for decades to build immunity, but he also experimented with oral ingestion, reporting no major issues from drinking it. This aligns with scientific understanding but is not recommended due to unpredictable risks.

Alcohol-Related Incidents: A 2017 study found that many snakebite victims were intoxicated, leading to mishandling of snakes and accidental exposure. While not direct ingestion, some cases involved swallowing venom during handling.

In extreme cases, ingestion can lead to anaphylaxis or vascular effects if enzymes like kallikrein potentiate bradykinin, causing rapid collapse—though this is rare without injection.

## Why It's Still Dangerous: Risks and Warnings

Even if digestion neutralizes most venom, potential complications include:

Allergic reactions or anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals.

Contamination from bacteria in the snake's mouth, leading to infections.

Psychological effects in recreational use, fostering addiction or risky behavior.

Experts unanimously advise against consuming snake venom. As one toxicologist notes, "Bottom line, don't lick venom. Look for ice cream or chocolate if you feel like licking." Snakebites remain a global health issue, with venom causing thousands of deaths annually when injected.

Venom has medical value too—components are used in drugs for blood pressure and pain relief—but only in controlled, purified forms.
