# Kenya's Harambee Stars and Tanzania's Taifa Stars Knocked Out of CHAN 2024: Rivalry and Online Banter Ignite

The African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2024, co-hosted by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda under the "Pamoja" bid, saw both East African hosts exit in the quarterfinals on August 22, 2025. Kenya's Harambee Stars and Tanzania's Taifa Stars put up valiant efforts but were ultimately eliminated, sparking intense online banter between fans of the two neighboring countries. This article explores the events leading to their exits and the lively, often heated, exchanges on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter).

## The Road to Elimination: Harambee Stars' Journey

Kenya's Harambee Stars made history in their debut at CHAN 2024, advancing from the "Group of Death" which included powerhouses like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Angola, and Morocco. They stunned DRC with a 1-0 win, drew 1-1 with Angola, and edged Morocco 1-0 in a dramatic match played with 10 men. This unbeaten group stage run propelled them to the quarterfinals, drawing massive crowds and national pride.

However, their fairytale ended against Madagascar in the quarterfinals at Kasarani Stadium. After a hard-fought draw, the match went to penalties, where Harambee Stars lost 3-4. Coach Benni McCarthy's side showed resilience, but missed penalties sealed their fate. This was Kenya's first appearance in the tournament, and reaching the knockout stage was a milestone.

## Taifa Stars' Campaign and Exit

Tanzania's Taifa Stars, also co-hosts, dominated Group B with an unbeaten run, securing 10 points from four matches: three wins and one draw. They advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in history, marking a turning point under coach Hemed Suleiman. Their strong performance included a 2-1 victory that confirmed their spot.

In the quarterfinals, Taifa Stars faced Morocco at Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Despite home support, they lost 0-1, unable to overcome the North African giants. This exit came just hours after Kenya's loss, amplifying the regional drama.

## The East African Rivalry: Historical Context

The football rivalry between Kenya and Tanzania dates back decades, with matches often charged with national pride. Past encounters, such as Tanzania's losses to Kenya in youth tournaments or heated AFCON qualifiers, have fueled the fire. CHAN 2024 intensified this, as both teams' successes in the group stages led to pre-match trash-talk. Harambee Stars' coach McCarthy downplayed Tanzania, prompting Tanzanian officials to retort, "Wanatisha nani?" (Who are they scaring?). Tanzanian fans labeled Harambee Stars as "robots" motivated by money rather than patriotism.

## Online Banter: Fans Trade Barbs on Social Media

The simultaneous eliminations ignited a frenzy of online banter, particularly on X, where fans from both sides exchanged jabs, memes, and calls for friendly matches to settle scores.

Kenyans celebrated Tanzania's loss: Videos from Nairobi's fan zones showed crowds erupting in joy after Taifa Stars' defeat, just hours after their own team's exit. One user posted, "Suluhu and that Yanga spokesperson that called our Harambee Stars players 'robots' come out!!!"

Tanzanians fired back: Commentators expressed fear of Kenya's form earlier but mocked them post-loss. Fans called Harambee Stars "nothing" and "empty sets," predicting dominance. A Tanzanian official dismissed Kenya's confidence as arrogance.

Calls for resolution: Suggestions emerged for two-legged friendlies between the teams to "end this debate once and for all." Pundits urged Taifa Stars to meet Harambee Stars in the finals, though both exited early.

Broader sentiments: Some posts highlighted mutual respect amid rivalry, while others blamed coaches or governments. The banter reignited classic East African football debates, with fans using humor and sarcasm to cope with disappointment.

## Why the Rivalry Endures

This CHAN edition showcased East Africa's growing football prowess, with both teams achieving historic milestones. Yet, the banter underscores deeper national pride and regional competition. As one analyst noted, matches between Kenya and Tanzania are "more than football," carrying bragging rights. Despite the losses, the tournament boosted local football, with record crowds and renewed interest.

As the dust settles, fans look forward to future clashes, perhaps in AFCON or friendlies, where the rivalry will undoubtedly continue.
