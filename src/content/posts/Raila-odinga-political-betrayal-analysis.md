The man once hailed as the champion of Kenya's democratic struggle has fallen so far from grace that his name now synonymous with political betrayal. Raila Odinga's shocking alliance with President William Ruto and his recent statements attacking media outlets exposing corruption represent the final nail in the coffin of what was once a distinguished political career. The 79-year-old veteran politician has not only betrayed the Kenyan people who trusted him for decades, but has also systematically destroyed his own legacy in the most spectacular fashion possible.

### From Liberation Hero to Government Lackey

Raila Odinga's transformation from Kenya's leading opposition figure to President Ruto's most prominent cheerleader represents one of the most stunning political betrayals in African history. The man who spent decades fighting authoritarian rule, who was detained without trial for his democratic beliefs, who mobilized millions against government excesses, has now become the very thing he once opposed – a defender of the corrupt status quo.

The seeds of this betrayal were planted in July 2024 when, during the height of Gen Z protests that saw over 50 young Kenyans killed by police, Raila chose to side with the oppressor rather than the oppressed. While young people were being shot in the streets for demanding accountability, Raila was quietly negotiating his entry into the same government they were protesting against.

By August 2024, four of his closest ODM allies – John Mbadi, Hassan Joho, Wycliffe Oparanya, and Opiyo Wandayi – had been appointed to Ruto's cabinet. This was not mere political pragmatism; it was a calculated abandonment of the very principles that had defined Raila's political career.

The formalization of this betrayal came on March 7, 2025, when Raila signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ruto at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. Standing before Kenyans, he referred to the man he had spent years condemning as corrupt as "my brother" – a moment that will forever define his political obituary.

### The Ultimate Betrayal: Attacking Anti-Corruption Media

If Raila's alliance with Ruto was shocking, his statements on August 14, 2025, at the Devolution Conference in Homa Bay were nothing short of scandalous. In a breathtaking display of how far he has fallen, Raila attacked the very media outlets that have been exposing the corruption his new government partners are involved in.

"If you see the media saying oh we have exposing corruption here they have been paid... If you see the media exposing corruption in legislature, in judiciary, in the executive, they themselves have been paid to do what they're doing," Raila declared, parroting the same talking points used by corrupt officials worldwide to discredit investigative journalism.

This statement represents the complete ideological collapse of a man who once championed press freedom. The same Raila who relied on independent media to expose the excesses of previous governments now attacks journalists for doing their job. The same man who used media platforms to build his political career now dismisses their corruption exposés as paid propaganda.

The timing of these statements is particularly damning – coming just days after the BBC documentary exposing child sex trafficking in Kenya, which his new government allies are desperately trying to discredit. Raila has essentially become a spokesperson for those who want to silence investigative journalism and protect corrupt networks.

### The Systematic Destruction of Kenya's Opposition

Raila's betrayal extends far beyond personal political calculations. By joining Ruto's government, he has single-handedly dismantled Kenya's opposition structure, leaving the country without effective checks and balances. His ODM party, once the backbone of Kenya's democratic opposition, has been reduced to a government cheerleading squad.

The impact has been devastating:

**Parliamentary Collapse**: With ODM MPs now supporting the government, opposition oversight has virtually disappeared. Critical bills pass without scrutiny, and government accountability has become a thing of the past.

**Coalition Fragmentation**: The Azimio coalition, which Raila led in 2022, has collapsed. Former allies like Martha Karua and Kalonzo Musyoka have been forced to distance themselves from his betrayal, leaving the opposition scattered and ineffective.

**Youth Alienation**: Perhaps most damaging is Raila's complete loss of credibility among Kenya's youth. The Gen Z movement that emerged in 2024 explicitly rejected his involvement, declaring: "You do not speak for us... We will drain the swamp with you in it."

The youth's rejection was not just tactical – it was ideological. They recognized that Raila had become part of the problem they were fighting against. When young people say they will "drain the swamp with you in it," they are not just rejecting Raila; they are burying his political relevance forever.

### The Destruction of a Hard-Earned Legacy

For over four decades, Raila Odinga built a legacy as Kenya's foremost champion of democracy and human rights. He was detained for his beliefs, fought against single-party dictatorship, championed the 2010 Constitution, and led countless struggles for social justice. That legacy is now in ruins, destroyed by his own hand.

**The Liberation Credentials**: Raila's role in Kenya's liberation struggle has been permanently tainted. Future historians will remember him not as the man who fought for democracy, but as the one who betrayed it when it mattered most.

**The Democratic Champion**: His decades of advocating for electoral reforms, constitutional governance, and human rights now ring hollow. How can someone who joins a government accused of killing protesters claim to champion human rights?

**The Opposition Icon**: Raila's identity as an opposition leader is finished. He can never again credibly claim to represent those fighting against government excesses because he has become the government.

**The People's President**: The man who was once sworn in as "the People's President" has revealed himself to be nothing more than another elite politician willing to sacrifice principles for power.

### The Complete Collapse of Political Credibility

Raila's statements and actions since joining Ruto's government have revealed the extent of his ideological bankruptcy. His defense of the alliance as necessary to "save Kenya" insults the intelligence of Kenyans who understand that he simply wanted a seat at the table of power.

His claim that he "doesn't regret" working with Ruto demonstrates a complete disconnection from the reality of Kenya's suffering under the current administration. While ordinary Kenyans struggle with high cost of living, increased taxes, and government corruption, Raila celebrates his alliance with those responsible.

His attack on corruption-exposing media shows that he has fully internalized the mindset of the corrupt elite he now serves. This is not the same man who once relied on press freedom to build his political career – this is someone who has been completely co-opted by the system.

### The Death of His Political Future

At 79, Raila Odinga's political future is not just uncertain – it is finished. His alliance with Ruto has destroyed any remaining credibility he might have had for future political endeavors.

**The 2027 Elections**: Whether Raila runs in 2027 or not, his relevance is over. If he runs, he will face the wrath of a youth demographic that has completely rejected him. If he doesn't run, he will be remembered as the man who sold out at the crucial moment.

**The AU Bid Consequences**: His failed bid for the African Union Commission chairmanship in February 2025 has exposed him as a leader without continental credibility. His loss, despite Ruto's support, demonstrated that even African leaders could see through his opportunistic transformation.

**The Base Erosion**: Traditional ODM strongholds in Nyanza, Coast, and Western Kenya are increasingly questioning their loyalty to a man who betrayed everything they stood for. Local leaders are distancing themselves from his decisions, and the party machinery he built over decades is crumbling.

**The Youth Replacement**: Most significantly, Kenya's energized youth movement has made it clear that they see Raila as part of the old, corrupt political class that must be replaced. They represent the future of Kenyan politics, and they have decisively rejected him.

### The Ideological Vacuum Left Behind

Raila's betrayal has created an ideological vacuum in Kenyan politics that reveals the bankruptcy of the country's political elite. His transformation from opposition leader to government defender demonstrates that Kenya's political class has no genuine ideological differences – they are all part of the same corrupt system, fighting only for their share of the spoils.

The man who once represented the hopes and aspirations of millions has shown that those hopes were misplaced. His alliance with Ruto proves that Kenya's political leaders are interchangeable parts in the same corrupt machine, willing to sacrifice any principle for access to power.

This revelation has profound implications for Kenya's democratic development. If even Raila Odinga can be bought and co-opted, what hope do ordinary Kenyans have that any political leader will truly represent their interests?

### Conclusion: The Final Verdict on a Fallen Titan

Raila Odinga's political career is over, killed not by his opponents but by his own betrayal of everything he once claimed to represent. His alliance with Ruto, his attack on anti-corruption media, and his complete disconnection from the struggles of ordinary Kenyans have destroyed whatever remained of his credibility.

The man who could have retired as a democratic hero will instead be remembered as the ultimate political opportunist who sold his soul for a place in government. His legacy is not just tarnished – it is destroyed beyond repair.

Future generations of Kenyans will study Raila's fall as a cautionary tale about how political ambition can corrupt even the most seemingly principled leaders. They will learn that no politician, no matter how distinguished their past, can be trusted with the people's hopes and dreams.

Kenya's democratic struggle will continue, but it will do so without Raila Odinga. The torch he once carried has been picked up by a new generation that has seen through his betrayal and rejected everything he now represents. They understand what Raila forgot – that true leadership means standing with the people even when it costs you everything, not abandoning them the moment you get a chance to join their oppressors.

The final chapter of Raila Odinga's political career has been written, and it is a story not of triumph, but of the spectacular self-destruction of a man who chose power over principle, comfort over conscience, and personal gain over the people's trust. History will not be kind to his memory.
