### From Champions League Winner to Coaching Prodigy

McCarthy's coaching journey began after a stellar playing career, including a 2004 UEFA Champions League title with FC Porto. His first major role came at Cape Town City in South Africa's Premier Soccer League (2017,2019), where he led the team to a fifth,place finish and the 2016 Telkom Knockout title, earning praise for his attacking philosophy. In 2020, he took over AmaZulu FC, guiding them to a historic second,place finish in the 2020,21 season, securing CAF Champions League qualification, a feat that cemented his reputation as a transformative coach.

### Manchester United Mentorship and Tactical Evolution

In 2022, McCarthy joined Manchester United as a forwards coach under Erik ten Hag. His work with stars like Marcus Rashford, who scored 30 goals in the 2022,23 season, showcased his ability to elevate attacking play. McCarthy's time at United, culminating in the 2023 EFL Cup triumph, sharpened his tactical acumen, blending European precision with South African flair. When he took over Harambee Stars in 2024, skeptics questioned whether he could adapt to Kenya's football landscape, but his results have silenced doubters.

### Masterclass Against Morocco

On August 10, McCarthy's genius shone at Kasarani. Despite Marvin Nabwire's red card in the 21st minute, his tactical 4,4,1 setup stifled Morocco's attack. In the 40th minute, Ryan Ogam latched onto Aboud Omar's through ball, firing a low shot for a 1,0 lead that sent fans, some storming the gates, into delirium. McCarthy's second,half substitutions, including Daniel Sakari and Aboud Omar for Mohammed Siraj and Suleiman Manzur, fortified Kenya's defense. A VAR no,penalty call in the 68th minute, denying Morocco, sparked roars, reflecting McCarthy's ability to inspire resilience.

### Building a Legacy in Kenyan Football

His CHAN campaign has been stellar: a 1-0 win over DR Congo, a 1-1 draw against Angola, and now the 1-0 Morocco upset, securing seven points and Group A's top spot. "I came to awaken lions," McCarthy said post,match. "This team, these fans, they're unstoppable." Supporter Aisha Wanjiku, among the gatecrashers, added, "Benni's our spark. He's made us believe we're giants!"

From Cape Town to Manchester to Nairobi, McCarthy's career, marked by trophies, upsets, and player development, has redefined Kenyan football. On August 10, 2025, as Kasarani roared, McCarthy proved he's not just a coach but a catalyst for a nation's footballing dreams, leading Harambee Stars to a historic quarter,final berth.
