President William Ruto, Kenya's leader since 2022, has seized upon the African Nations Championship (CHAN) 2025, co-hosted by Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, as a golden opportunity to bolster his political image ahead of the 2027 general elections. By intertwining football, money, and politics, Ruto aims to project an image of national unity, infrastructural progress, and personal generosity, hoping to sway voters disillusioned by his administration's handling of Kenya's myriad challenges. However, this calculated strategy, relying on lavish financial incentives, controlled public appearances, and heavy-handed political branding, is likely to implode spectacularly, as it fails to address deep-seated public grievances and risks amplifying perceptions of Ruto as a disconnected, self-serving leader.

### Ruto's CHAN Strategy: A Political Playbook
Ruto has positioned himself as the face of CHAN 2025, leveraging the tournament's regional spotlight to craft a narrative of competent leadership and national pride. In mid-July 2025, he conducted high-profile inspections of key venues, such as the Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium, emphasizing Kenya's preparedness to host an international event. These visits were less about logistics and more about showcasing his government's ability to deliver tangible infrastructure improvements, a key campaign promise from 2022. By tying his administration to the tournament's success, Ruto seeks to claim credit for any positive outcomes, from upgraded facilities to a well-executed event.

His engagement with the Harambee Stars, Kenya's national team, further underscores this strategy. In late July, Ruto made surprise visits to the team's training camp, urging players to "focus on winning the CHAN title" and promising unwavering government support. These appearances were carefully staged to portray him as a hands-on leader invested in national glory. Beyond rhetoric, Ruto has deployed significant financial muscle to incentivize performance, offering unprecedented rewards that dwarf previous sports budgets. Following Kenya's victory over Morocco in early August 2025, he announced a staggering Sh600 million (approximately $4.6 million USD) prize pool for the team if they win the tournament. This includes Sh1 million per player for each win, Sh500,000 per draw, and additional bonuses like Sh2.5 million per player for reaching the quarterfinals. In a theatrical flourish, Ruto vowed to "fulfill any wish" of the players and technical team upon victory, including houses and other perks, funded partly by the Sports Ministry's Sh70 million reward budget and supplemented by his personal commitments.

Behind the scenes, Ruto's United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party has orchestrated a more manipulative approach to control the tournament's optics. Reports indicate that UDA has purchased over half the tickets for key matches, such as Kenya's opening game against the Democratic Republic of Congo, to fill stadiums with loyalists and prevent anti-government sentiment from surfacing. This move, allegedly prompted by National Intelligence Service warnings of potential "Ruto Must Go" or "One Term" chants, aims to create a curated atmosphere where support for the team doubles as endorsement of Ruto's leadership. Social media discussions suggest that Ruto and his allies plan to weave CHAN's successes, whether hosting prowess or on-field victories, into their 2027 re-election campaign, framing the tournament as a symbol of Kenya's progress under Ruto's stewardship.
