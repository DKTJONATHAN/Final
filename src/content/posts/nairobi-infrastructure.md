### Regional Economic Surge Outpaces Continental Performance

The Africa Development Bank's latest projections reveal East Africa's exceptional economic momentum, with growth accelerating from 4.3% in 2024 to 5.9% in 2025—representing an upward revision of 0.6 percentage points[192]. This performance significantly outpaces the continental average of 3.9% and establishes East Africa as the fastest-growing region in Africa.

Kenya leads this charge with projected GDP growth of 5.2% in 2025, rising to 5.4% in 2026, supported by robust agricultural performance and industrial sector recovery[193]. The country's economy demonstrated remarkable resilience in Q1 2025, achieving 4.9% real GDP growth despite global headwinds[201]. Ethiopia follows closely with an ambitious 7.2% growth projection, while Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda are all expected to average 6% or higher growth rates through 2026[192].

The region's economic diversification has proven crucial to its resilience. As the AfDB notes, "East Africa's resilience to shocks may be explained by the region being home to some of the most diversified economies in Africa, with a growing share of manufactured goods in intra-regional trade and relatively strong regional trade penetration"[192].

### Manufacturing Renaissance Fuels Industrial Growth

East Africa's manufacturing sector is experiencing a dramatic renaissance, with the region positioning itself as a critical hub for light manufacturing across the continent. The sector grew 3.2% in 2024 and is projected to expand 3.5% in 2025, with significant increases in both GDP contribution and employment generation[197].

Africa's manufacturing sector as a whole is projected to achieve a value-added output of $77.66 billion and total output of $284.70 billion in 2025[191]. East African countries are capturing an increasing share of this growth, with Kenya, Ethiopia, and Rwanda emerging as key manufacturing destinations.

Kenya's manufacturing sector has shown particular strength, contributing 9.2% to GDP and supporting 456,000 jobs in 2024. The sector is expected to reach 9.5% of GDP and create 500,000 jobs by 2025[197]. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers reports robust performance across multiple sub-sectors, with strong growth in textiles, automotive assembly, and agro-processing.

Ethiopia's industrial transformation represents one of Africa's most ambitious manufacturing stories, with the government investing $1.3 billion in industrial parks and targeting thirty fully operational facilities by 2025[191]. The Hawassa Industrial Park and similar developments have attracted over 80 foreign investors from China, India, Turkey, and South Korea, demonstrating Ethiopia's growing appeal as a low-cost manufacturing destination.

**Key Manufacturing Performance Indicators (2025 Projections):**

### Fintech Revolution Drives Digital Transformation

East Africa's fintech sector continues to lead global innovation, with Kenya maintaining its position as the world's mobile money capital. The sector's performance in 2025 demonstrates both maturation and continued expansion, albeit with evolving dynamics that reflect changing consumer behavior and market sophistication.

Kenya's mobile money ecosystem processed KES 7.2 trillion (approximately $55.81 billion) in the first ten months of 2024, with registered accounts reaching 81 million[204]. Mobile banking apps and USSD-based transactions account for 45.7% and 38.2% of digital payments respectively, demonstrating the deep penetration of mobile financial services.

However, the sector is experiencing a structural transformation. While subscriptions increased from 77.3 million to 84.6 million, transaction values dropped 19.6% from KES 790.8 billion to KES 636.2 billion in the year to February 2025[209]. This apparent contradiction reflects economic pressures on household spending and the migration of higher-value transactions to banking platforms.

Safaricom's M-PESA maintains dominance with a 91% market share, processing over 61 million transactions daily and serving more than 50 million active users in Kenya alone[214]. The platform's evolution from simple money transfers to a comprehensive financial ecosystem encompasses savings, lending, insurance, and merchant services.

**Fintech Market Expansion Metrics:**

- **Market Growth**: 14.1% CAGR projected through 2028, reaching $14.54 billion market value[214]
- **Financial Inclusion**: 83.7% formal financial access, up from 26.6% in 2006[206]
- **Mobile Penetration**: 145.3% mobile subscription rate with 76.16 million subscribers[212]
- **Agent Network**: 416,994 registered mobile money agents, growing 5.5% quarterly[212]

### Technology Sector Powers Innovation Economy

Kenya's technology sector has emerged as a continental leader, attracting $638 million in startup funding in 2024—representing 29% of Africa's total $2.2 billion funding and growing 3% while other major markets declined[207]. This exceptional performance reflects the sector's maturation and increasing investor confidence in East African innovation capabilities.

The funding landscape has shifted strategically from fintech dominance to climate-tech and agri-tech solutions. Climate technology alone accounted for 46% of total funding, with major deals including d.light ($176 million), M-Kopa ($51 million), and BasiGo ($42 million)[207]. This transition demonstrates the sector's evolution toward addressing critical developmental challenges while maintaining commercial viability.

Kenya's National AI Strategy represents a $1 billion commitment through 2030, focused on developing essential digital infrastructure including a national "AI cloud," expanding fiber optic networks, and creating edge computing capabilities[207]. The centerpiece Konza Technopolis will host supercomputing facilities and an AI innovation park, positioning Kenya as Africa's artificial intelligence hub.

**Technology Sector Highlights:**

- **Infrastructure**: 90% clean energy grid supporting tech development[207]

### Monetary Policy Success Drives Economic Stability

Kenya's Central Bank has demonstrated exceptional policy acumen, implementing seven consecutive rate cuts since August 2024 to create an optimal environment for economic growth. The benchmark Central Bank Rate now stands at 9.50%, reduced from previous highs to stimulate private sector lending and economic expansion[190].

This accommodative monetary policy has achieved remarkable success in maintaining price stability while supporting growth. Inflation remained within the target range at 4.1% in July 2025, well below the midpoint of the 5±2.5% target band[193]. The policy framework has successfully balanced growth stimulation with inflation control, creating an ideal environment for business investment and expansion.

Commercial bank lending to the private sector has responded positively, growing 3.3% in July 2025 compared to -2.9% in January 2025[193]. Average lending rates have declined to 15.2% from 17.2% in November 2024, significantly improving credit accessibility for businesses and consumers.

**Key Monetary Indicators:**

- **Central Bank Rate**: 9.50% (350 basis points reduction since August 2024)[190]
- **Inflation Rate**: 4.1% (within 2.5-7.5% target range)[190]
- **Private Credit Growth**: 3.3% year-over-year in July 2025[193]
- **Exchange Rate Stability**: USD 129.24 per dollar, maintaining competitiveness[202]
