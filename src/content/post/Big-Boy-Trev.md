Big Boy Trev, often dubbed Kenya's Jeremy Clarkson, rose to fame through his engaging 24-minute automotive magazine show, *Cars with Big Boy Trev*, which aired on NTV Kenya and previously on KTN Home. The program, East Africa's premier motoring TV show, covered everything from high-end vehicle launches to critical commentary on Kenya's car culture. His 2022 YouTube segment, *Why Kenyan Matatus Are Death Traps*, gained significant attention for addressing road safety issues with his signature blend of wit and insight, resonating with viewers across the country.

Trev's charisma and expertise made him a pivotal figure in Kenya's automotive industry. At the 2019 launch of his show on KTN Home, he promised never-before-seen content for car enthusiasts, a commitment he fulfilled by collaborating with major brands like Toyota Kenya, BMW, and Subaru. Joe Munene, Standard Group's broadcast managing director, praised Trev's ability to reignite excitement for cars, saying, "Whether it's comfort, power, or speed, you will find whatever you're looking for in this show."

Details surrounding Trev's illness and passing remain limited. No official statements from NTV Kenya or his family have been released, and the lack of prior reports about his health has amplified the shock among fans, many of whom took to social media to express their grief. Big Boy Trev's influence extended beyond entertainment, as he advocated for safer roads and inspired countless viewers to engage with Kenya's automotive culture. Funeral arrangements are yet to be announced.
