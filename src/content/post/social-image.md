# From Kibaki to Maraga: Can Kenya’s Economy Rise Again?

*Economics Meets Governance. Kibaki and Maraga both hate corruption, but their toolkits couldn’t be more different.*

As Kenya approaches the **2027 elections**, the nation finds itself at a pivotal moment. Under President **William Ruto**, economic struggles—high taxes, inflation, and public unrest—have fueled widespread discontent. Into this fray steps **David Maraga**, the former Chief Justice, campaigning to *“Reset, Restore, Rebuild”* Kenya. His candidacy invites comparisons to **Mwai Kibaki**, the economist-turned-president who rescued Kenya’s economy after decades of mismanagement under **Daniel arap Moi**.

## Kibaki’s Economic Turnaround: A Lesson in *“Kibakinomics”*

When Mwai Kibaki became president in December 2002, Kenya was on its knees. Economic growth had stalled at 0.6%, corruption was bleeding the country dry, and international donors had turned their backs. Kibaki rolled out a strategy blending fiscal discipline, privatization, and anti-corruption efforts.

### What Kibaki Did and How It Worked:
1. **Tightened the Purse Strings**: Cut wasteful spending, reduced borrowing, and boosted tax collection.
2. **Privatization Push**: Sold state-owned companies to inject money without piling on debt.
3. **Cracked Down on Corruption**: Fired 400 procurement officers and pushed transparency.
4. **Vision 2030**: A long-term plan prioritizing infrastructure and jobs.
5. **Smart Balance**: Mixed free-market ideas with strategic government interventions.

*Results*: GDP growth hit **7.1%** by his first term’s end.

## Maraga’s Governance-First Approach

David Maraga isn’t an economist—he’s a judge with a reputation for integrity. As Chief Justice, he nullified the 2017 presidential election, cementing his image as a champion of fairness. Now, he blames *“governance failures”* for Kenya’s slide toward a *“failed state.”*

### Today’s Economic Mess Under Ruto:
1. **Tax Hikes and Inflation**: 50.5% of Kenyans say life’s gotten worse (Afrobarometer, 2024).
2. **Street Anger**: Protests have left over 100 dead (BBC News, July 2025).
3. **Debt Trouble**: Fiscal deficit at 4.3% of GDP.

### Kibaki vs. Maraga: Toolkit Comparison
| **Kibaki’s Strengths**          | **Maraga’s Potential**          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Economic expertise               | Governance and rule of law       |
| Measurable growth (7.1% GDP)     | Corruption crackdown             |
| Team of advisors                 | Needs economic brain trust       |

## Maraga’s Playbook: How He Could Turn Things Around
1. **Stronger Institutions**: Independent courts to lure investors.
2. **Corruption Cleanup**: Save billions lost to graft.
3. **Tax Relief**: Ease the squeeze on families.
4. **People-First Policies**: Rebuild faith in government.

*Challenge*: Maraga lacks Kibaki’s economic training—success hinges on his choice of advisors.

---

## The Bottom Line: Two Roads to Recovery
- **Kibaki’s legacy**: A roaring economy with political flaws.
- **Maraga’s promise**: A cleaner system that could enable prosperity.

*Kenya needs both: Kibaki’s savvy and Maraga’s moral compass.*

## Adding your own social image to a post

This post is an example of how to add a custom [open graph](https://ogp.me/) social image, also known as an OG image, to a blog post.
By adding the optional ogImage property to the frontmatter of a post, you opt out of [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) automatically generating an image for this page.

If you open this markdown file `src/content/post/social-image.md` you'll see the ogImage property set to an image which lives in the public folder[^1].

```yaml
ogImage: "/social-card.png"
```

You can view the one set for this template page [here](https://astro-cactus.chriswilliams.dev/social-card.png).

[^1]: The image itself can be located anywhere you like.
